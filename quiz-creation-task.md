Read the following statements and consider an information system based on the dialogue between Emi and Shinji. 
Then, create a quiz to ask learners about their knowledge of programming (in particular, control struc-tures) to realize that system. You may refer to the image attached below the description. (Images are omitted)

Dentsu High School holds a school festival every year, which is characterized by each class opening a unique booth. This year, Emi's class planned to sell candy fruits. As preparations for the school festival were underway, Emi and Kenji came up with the idea of utilizing programming to run the booth and were en-thusiastically discussing its functions.

Emi: “We are going to have a bake sale at the school festival, and this year we are going to have a fruit candy shop. It would be nice if we could somehow keep track of the ingredients and the number of candies we can sell at any given time for each.”

Kenji: “Yes, that's right. If we can manage the inventory smoothly, customers will not have to wait, and we will be able to work more easily. How about a function that warns us to make new candies when the number of candies sold drops below a certain number?”

Emi: “That's a good idea! If we reduce the number of ingredients in our inventory with each candy we make, it will be easier to see how much we have left.” 

Kenji: “Sure. That way, if there is a candy that is sold out, we can immediately display a 'sold out' sign. It would be easy for customers to understand, and we would know immediately which candy we need to re-stock.”

Emi: “Also, it would be nice to check the list of ingredients at the end of the day so that you can add to your shopping list what you might run out of. That should make the next day's preparations go a lot smoother.”

Kenji: “Yeah, let's go with that! Our fruit candy shop is going to be a huge success!”
